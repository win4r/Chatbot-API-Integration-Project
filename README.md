# Chatbot-API-Integration-Project
This project demonstrates how to transition a traditional chatbot, initially interacted with through Selenium, to a more scalable and robust API-driven model. By leveraging Flask-SocketIO, this transformation enhances the chatbot's responsiveness and allows for real-time interaction without the overhead of a browser interface.
